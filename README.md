### What I learned

Learnt a lot about positioning.
Trying to build this project with relative & absolute positioning was challenging, but it made me research more on how positioning works. I later used display: flex to center my card, but I learnt a lot trying to do it with relative & absolute positioning.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

/* global classes */
.container {
  max-width: 340px;
  margin: 0, auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.
